\begin{abstract}
The aim of this project is to study the performance of linear regression in order to fit a two dimensional polynomial to terrain data. Both Ordinary Least Square (OLS), Ridge and Lasso regression methods were implemented, and for minimizing Lasso's cost function Gradient Descent (GD) was used. A fourth method was to minimize the cost function of Ridge using GD. The fitted polynomial was visualized and compared with the data, the Mean Square Error (MSE) and R$^2$-score were analyzed, and finally the polynomial coefficients were studied applying visualization tools and Confidence Intervals (CI). To benchmark the results, we used Scikit Learn.

We found the self-implemented OLS and Ridge regression functions to reproduce the benchmarks, and Lasso was close to reproducing the benchmark as well. However, the difference between results produced by standard Ridge regression and when minimizing its cost function is large. The OLS regression method is considered as the most successful due to its small MSE and high R$^2$-score.
