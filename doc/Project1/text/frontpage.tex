\begin{abstract}
This project aims studying the ground state (GS) energy of neural atoms with total spin zero. More precisely we look at Helium and Beryllium, and we limit ourselves to the single-particle orbits 1s, 2s and 3s. Both Configuration interaction (CI) and Hartree-Fock (HF) were used to estimate the energy levels, and as benchmarks, recent experimental energy values were used.

For Helium, we found the Configuration Interaction singles (CIS) to give the lowest energy with a relative error of 2.24\%, compared to 2.50\% by using HF. For Beryllium, the situation was different, with 1.08\% relative error when using HF and 2.08\% relative error when using CIS.
