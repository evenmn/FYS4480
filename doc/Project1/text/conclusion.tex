\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
Based on the results we have obtained, we can conclude that our implementations are successful. What we have seen, is that for the Helium atom, CIS gives the best result, while for the Beryllium atom HF gives best result. This might be caused by the fact that Beryllium has more electrons, so they have not so many states to be excited to. 

By including the doubles as well (performing a CISD), we would probably got a way lower energy.
